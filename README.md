# Traffic-Collision-Forecasting
## Modeling
- Moving Average (MA) Model: This uses a simple smoothing technique that averages a fixed window of past data to predict future values.

- ARIMA Model: The ARIMA model combines autoregressive, differencing (integrated), and moving average components to forecast based on past values and residuals. The auto_arima function helps to find the best parameters for ARIMA automatically.

- Prophet Model: This model is useful for time series with strong seasonality and handles missing data automatically. Itâ€™s suitable for monthly, weekly, and yearly data trends.
